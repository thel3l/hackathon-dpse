What is a Hackathon?

A Hackathon is an event where participants known as ‘Hackers’ work in teams collaboratively to ‘Hack’ on an idea. These ideas are transformed into innovative technology products including, but not limited to mobile apps, websites,and hardware. In other words, talented developers get together, and code something awesome.


What platforms/ languages are allowed?

Participants are free to use any Language and any platform. The final application can be mobile or a desktop app. We will be setting up a Github Enterprise Server at the venue, for version control. Therefore we recommended that participants be familiar with Git, and version control.


Do we sign up as individuals or as a team?

You have to sign up as individuals but you’ll be free to team up with whoever you want. You can form teams prior to the event or during the event. You can also chose to work alone.


What will the theme for the Hackathon be?

The theme for the Hackathon will be announced on-the-spot. Participants are requested not to bring along any code with them, and winning submissions will be subject to code review.
