Hack, meet new people, get creative, and have a good time. Getting something meaningful done within such a short amount of time can be stressful, but we'd like to encourage everyone to take a break every now and then to relax and enjoy the event.
To ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music and assets MUST be created during the duration of the Hackathon. We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. The only exception to this rule would include material that is freely available to the public like Creative Commons Images and third party APIs.
You can have a maximum of 5 members in a team.
