The rules for the programme are:

1. A team can have a maximum of 5 members.
2. To ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music and other assets MUST be created during the duration of the Hackathon. We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. The only exception to this rule would include material that is freely available to the public like Creative Commons Images and third party APIs.
3. Winning submissions may be subject to code review. Be kind to others. Co-operate with the school administration. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event. Hack, meet new people, get creative, and have a good time. Getting something meaningful done within such a short amount of time can be stressful, but we'd like to encourage everyone to take a break every now and then to relax and enjoy the event.
